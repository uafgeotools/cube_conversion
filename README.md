cube_conversion
===============

This command-line tool converts [DiGOS](https://digos.eu/) DATA-CUBE<sup>3</sup>
files into miniSEED files of a desired length of time with specified metadata.
Output miniSEED files have units of Pa, unless the user selects to export the files in
a form suitable for submission to EarthScope (formerly IRIS). The tool
can differentiate between channels for 3 channel DATA-CUBE<sup>3</sup> files and
optionally extract coordinates from the digitizer's GPS. The code only looks for
files from digitizers defined in the `digitizer_sensor_pairs.json` file. Therefore,
this file must be updated if pairings change or new pairings are added. The user
can specify a custom "breakout box factor" for setups that modify the signal
voltage via a voltage divider. This tool is currently only set up for conversion
of infrasound data, but future updates will accommodate seismic as well.

Installation
------------

It's recommended that you run this script within a new or pre-existing
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment.
(If you choose the latter option, ensure that your environment contains all of
the packages listed in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.)

To create a new conda environment for use with this and other _uafgeotools_
packages, execute the following terminal command:
```
$ conda create -n uafinfra -c conda-forge obspy
```
This creates a new environment called `uafinfra` with ObsPy and its dependencies
installed.

You must also install GIPPtools and add it to your path as described in the
[Dependencies](#dependencies) section.

To install _cube_conversion_, simply execute the following terminal command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/uafgeotools/cube_conversion.git
```

Dependencies
------------

Python packages:

* [ObsPy](http://docs.obspy.org/)

...and its dependencies, which you don't really have to be concerned about if
you're using conda!

You also need to install
[GIPPtools](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/geophysical-imaging/infrastructure/geophysical-instrument-pool-potsdam-gipp/software/gipptools/)
and add it to your `PATH`.

* Version 2024.170 or newer is required and we encourage the user to always use the latest version.

* Add GIPPtools to your `PATH` by adding the following line to your
  `~/.zshrc` (for Z shell), `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.bashrc` (for Bash) :
  ```
  export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/gipptools-????.???/bin
  ```
  Replace `????.???` with your version of GIPPtools — e.g. `2024.170` — and
  ensure you've provided the right path.

Supplemental files
------------------

* `digitizer_sensor_pairs.json` — UAF digitizer-sensor pairs (**EDIT ME!**)

* `digitizer_offsets.json` — Digitizer offsets in V (We have found that each
                             digitizer has a slight voltage offset from zero)

* `sensor_sensitivities.json` — Infrasound sensor sensitivities in V/Pa

Usage
-----

To print the script's help menu, execute the following terminal commands:
```
$ conda activate uafinfra  # Or your pre-existing env
$ python /path/to/cube_convert.py --help
```
The help menu is shown below.
```
usage: cube_convert.py [-h] [-v] [--grab-gps]
                       [--bob-factor BREAKOUT_BOX_FACTOR] [--earthscope]
                       input_dir [input_dir ...] output_dir network station
                       {01,02,03,04,AUTO} {AUTO,BDF,HDF,CDF}

Convert DATA-CUBE files to miniSEED files while trimming, adding metadata, and
renaming. Optionally extract coordinates from digitizer GPS.

positional arguments:
  input_dir             one or more directories containing raw DATA-CUBE files
                        (all files must originate from a single digitizer)
                        [wildcards (*) supported]
  output_dir            directory for output miniSEED and GPS-related files
  network               desired SEED network code (2 characters, A-Z)
  station               desired SEED station code (3-4 characters, A-Z & 0-9)
  {01,02,03,04,AUTO}    desired SEED location code (if AUTO, choose
                        automatically for 3 channel DATA-CUBE files)
  {AUTO,BDF,HDF,CDF}    desired SEED channel code (if AUTO, determine
                        automatically using SEED convention [preferred])

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         enable verbosity for GIPPtools commands
  --grab-gps            additionally extract coordinates from digitizer GPS
  --bob-factor BREAKOUT_BOX_FACTOR
                        factor by which to divide sensitivity values (for
                        custom breakout boxes [4.5 for UAF DATA-CUBEs])
  --earthscope          format miniSEED files for EarthScope (formerly IRIS) data upload
```
For example, the command
```
$ python cube_convert.py ~/data/raw/*/ ~/data/mseed/ AV GAIA 01 AUTO --grab-gps --bob-factor 4.5
```
means "convert all files in the subdirectories of `~/data/raw/` and place in
`~/data/mseed/` with network code **AV**, station code **GAIA**, location code
**01**, and an automatically determined channel code, dividing the sensitivity
by 4.5 and extracting coordinates from the digitizer's GPS."

A note on SEED band codes
-------------------------

Appendix A of the
[SEED manual (version 2.4)](http://www.fdsn.org/pdf/SEEDManual_V2.4.pdf)
specifies the following guidance for band codes. Band codes are the first
letter of the channel code; e.g., the "B" in "BDF".

| Band code | Band type              | Sample rate (Hz)    | Corner period (s) |
| :-------- | :--------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------- |
| F         |                        | ≥ 1000 to < 5000    | ≥ 10              |
| G         |                        | ≥ 1000 to < 5000    | < 10              |
| D         |                        | ≥ 250 to < 1000     | < 10              |
| **C**     |                        | **≥ 250 to < 1000** | **≥ 10**          |
| E         | Extremely short-period | ≥ 80 to < 250       | < 10              |
| S         | Short-period           | ≥ 10 to < 80        | < 10              |
| **H**     | **High broadband**     | **≥ 80 to < 250**   | **≥ 10**          |
| **B**     | **Broadband**          | **≥ 10 to < 80**    | **≥ 10**          |
| M         | Mid-period             | > 1 to < 10         |                   |
| L         | Long-period            | ≈ 1                 |                   |
| V         | Very long-period       | ≈ 0.1               |                   |
| U         | Ultra long-period      | ≈ 0.01              |                   |
| R         | Extremely long-period  | ≥ 0.0001 to < 0.001 |                   |

Note that the band code depends on both the sample rate of the digitizer and
the corner period of the sensor. In `cube_convert.py` we allow for "B", "H", or
"C", which covers a range of sample rates from 10 to 1000 Hz, all for corner
periods of 10 s or greater. While this covers most infrasound sensors, please
confirm that your digitizer sample rate and sensor corner period fit into the
above framework.
